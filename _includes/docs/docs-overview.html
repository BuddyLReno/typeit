	<h3>Overview</h3>

		TypeIt is the most versatile jQuery typewriter effect plugin on the planet. In simple use, it allows you to type single or multiple strings that break lines, delete &amp; replace each other, and it even handles HTML tags &amp; entities.

		For more advanced, controlled typing effects, TypeIt comes with companion functions that can be chained to control your typing down to the smallest character, enabling you to type an dynamic narrative, with complete control over speed, characters, line breaks, deletions, pausing, everything.
